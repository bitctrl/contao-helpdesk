============================
TYPOlight Helpdesk CHANGELOG
============================

Version 1.3.0 (2010-02-16)
--------------------------
- Add a waiting time in the settings. New messages will only get marked as edited
  after the waiting  time, giving the message poster some time to make corrections
  without being marked as edited right from the start.
  
- For versions below 2.8.0 the pagination is done with the parameter 'pageno' to 
  work around an issue in the TL search indexer. In 2.8.0 the issues was addressed, 
  so the parameter ist named 'page' again in accordance to the TL standards.

- Allthough helpdesk is declared to be compatible from 2.7.6 to 2.8.0, please note
  that there is an issue with caching not reliably disabled in rc1 and rc2 of 2.8.0. 
  So the rc's are not compatible, only 2.8.0 stable is.

  
Version 1.2.0 (2010-02-10)
--------------------------
- Added a switch to the settings to enable TYPOlight search. When this is enabled,
  the forum/helpdesk messages will get included in the regular TYPOlight site search.
  Rebuild the search index in the backends maintenance page after enabling or
  disabling this option.
  
  In case you have a custom template for helpdesk_listmessages.tpl you need to adjust
  it. Find the changes in the original template in the lines containing $objPage
  and $hd->settings->tlsearch.

  Note that enabling this option can significantly increase the TYPOlight search
  index tables tl_search and tl_search_index, as well as the time taken to rebuild
  the index in the backend maintenance. The amount depends on how many topics/tickets
  are visible in all frontend helpdesk blocks.
  
- Regular forum/helpdesk search form reworked so advanced options are only shown 
  on demand. Adjustments on customized templates helpdesk_search.tpl are required,
  compare with the original template of the new version please.
  
- Fixed the long standing 'messed breadcrumb' issue.


Version 1.1.0 (2010-02-06)
--------------------------
- Added category options to enable attatchments in notifications and email imports.

- Reworked the forum comments module: 
  Comments may now be attached to the page, the article, a news item(*), a FAQ item(*) or an event(*)
  
  (*) Taken from the news-/faq-/eventreader module within the same article as the 
      helpdesk comments CE is in.

- Fixed occasional issue with UTF-8 in notifications (credit to Benjamin aka b2m).


Version 1.0.1 (2010-02-04)
--------------------------
- Fixed settings not shown in backend member/user settings of 2.7.6
- Fixed that the automatically created OP in article comments did not update the statistics.
- Fixed that the url-suffix in the settings was not recognized.
- Fixed that breadcrumb was wrong when directly displaying a ticket coming from another page.
- Fixed some german spellings.


Version 1.0.0 (2009-06-20)
--------------------------
- Adjustments for 2.7.1


Version 0.9.0 (2008-11-03)
--------------------------
- Improved breadcrumb:
  Keeps path when viewing and editing posts in search results, unread lists etc.

- Unread list changes:

  - The results are cached in session (for more convenience and speed when
    multiple pages of topics are found)

  - The list is stricly ordered by latest post.

  - "All read" within the unread list will only mark the topics read which are
    in the cached result list, before it would mark all categories as read
    which could make you miss a new message that was posted after fetching the
    list.

  - The category is now clickable to change directly to the thread list of the
    category.

- Display user contributions:

  - New index function "mine" to display all topics/tickets the current user has
    contributed to.

  - The function can also be used to display contributions of any frontend or
    backend user by using a customized link:

    Example link for current user, all cats on page 'forum', page #2:
    http://www.example.com/forum/mine/all.html?page=2

    Example link for frontend member d.evanvs, categories 5 and 7:
    http://www.example.com/forum/mine/5,7/member/d.evans.html

    Example link for backend user k.jones, all cats on page 'helpdesk':
    http://www.example.com/helpdesk/mine/all/user/k.jones.html

- Display recent posts:

  - Lists all topics/tickets with contributions in the last 24 hours.

  - The recent time frame can be modified in the helpdesk settings.

- Display unanswered tickets/topics:

  - List all topics/tickets which have no replies yet.

- Search improvements:

  - Mode 'Like' replaces 'exact'. SQL wildcards must be applied by user himself
    now.

  - Mode 'Like binary' works as 'like' but forces a binary (case insensitive)
    match.

  - Limit for # of returned matches in search results can now be configured in
    the helpdesk settings instead of editing HelpdeskConstants.php.

- Member profile linking (usable only from TYPOlight 2.6.2 up)

  - In the module "Forum/Helpdesk Block" there is a selection whom to display
    member profile links (nobody, moderators/supporters, users/clients or
	everybody). 
	
  - Another text input is for entering the page URL of the standard TYPOlight 
    member list module (without the member id which gets appended 
    automatically). The URL may be full qualified, or relative to the current 
    site root:

    Fully qualified:  http://www.example.com/memberlist.html
    Relative to root: memberlist.html

  - Only in posts created by frontend members the profile link will be 
    displayed, because there is no equivalent to the memberlist module for 
    backend users.

	
Version 0.8.3 (2008-09-15)
--------------------------
- Added alternate find mode so now we have:
  - All relevant messages (as before)
  - First match in relevant topics (new)
